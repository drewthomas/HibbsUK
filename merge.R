# 1. There's a really dodgy-looking jump in the English average for 1972
#    through 1980. Push those years' averages down to bring them in line with
#    the surrounding data.
# 2. Make the hopeful assumption that the gap between Welsh & English average
#    household sizes was constant before 1991, imputing Welsh AHS backwards
#    decadally from that.
# 3. Wedge the years 1962 through 1970 into `h` by copying rows and blanking
#    them, then linearly interpolate an annual time series for each country
#    in the UK for 1961 onwards.
# 4. Now extrapolate averages for NI, Scotland, & Wales by extending the
#    straight best-fit line to the 2001-2016 data through that whole period.
# 5. Turn to household counts, which are a prerequisite for recomputing
#    average household size. Extrapolate missing household counts for NI,
#    Scotland, England, & Wales by straightforward linear interpolation.
# 6. Fill in remaining gaps in the UK average household size series by
#    taking a household-count-weighted average of the individual countries'
#    average household sizes.
